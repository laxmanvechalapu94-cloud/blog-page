                <p>Machine learning in R allows data scientists, analysts and statisticians to build predictive models, uncover patterns and gain
                    insights using powerful statistical techniques combined with modern machine learning algorithms. </p>

                <p>Data refers to the set of observations or measurements to train a machine learning models. The performance of such models is heavily 
                    influenced by both the quality and quantity of data available for training and testing. Machine learning algorithms cannot be trained without data.</p>

                   <p>Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or
                     data to help machine learning models learn patterns more effectively. </p>

                <summary>Supervised Learning</summary>
                <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled data—meaning every input has a corresponding correct output.
                     The model makes predictions and compares them with the true outputs, adjusting itself to reduce errors and improve accuracy over time.</p>

            <p class="ab">Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms 
            that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, 
            ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.</p><br>
